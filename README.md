# Py to Js VS Code Extension

This extension is used to translate python to js files. The extension is enabled when the active file has a `.py` extension. 
The extension uses [py-to-js lib](https://github.com/kood-codes/py-to-js).

This extension is used as a demonstration for my blog [Translating programming languages like google translate](https://blog.kood.dev).

```
